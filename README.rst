Ccdproc is is an affiliated package for the AstroPy package for basic data
reductions of CCD images.   The ccdproc  package provides many of the
necessary tools for processing of ccd images built on a framework to provide
error propagation and bad pixel tracking throughout the reduction process.

Ccdproc can currently be installed via pip or from the source code.  For
installation instructions, see the `online documentation`_ or docs/install.rst
in this source distribution.


Documentation is at `ccdproc.readthedocs.io
