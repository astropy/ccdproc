- deprecated ``summary_info`` property of ``ImageFileCollection`` now raises
  a deprecation warning. [#486]

- Logging will include the abbreviation even if the ``meta`` attribute of
  the processed ``CCDData`` isn't a ``fits.Header``. [#528]

- The ``CCDData`` class and the functions ``fits_ccddata_reader`` and

  given ``keys`` argument. [#534]

1.2.0 (2016-12-13)
------------------

ccdproc has now the following additional dependency:

  - scikit-image.


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  [#402]

- Added ``median_filter`` function. [#420]

  which is passed as ``uncertainty_func`` parameter to
  ``Combiner.median_combine`` or ``Combiner.average_combine``. [#416]

- Added ``ccdmask`` function. [#414, #432]


Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ccdprocs core functions now explicitly add HIERARCH cards. [#359, #399, #413]

- ``combine`` now accepts a ``dtype`` argument which is passed to
  ``Combiner.__init__``. [#391, #392]

- Removed ``CaseInsensitiveOrderedDict`` because it is not used in the current
  code base. [#428]


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- The default dtype of the ``combine``-result doesn't depend on the dtype
  of the first CCDData anymore. This also corrects the memory consumption
  calculation. [#391, #392]

- ``ccd_process`` now copies the meta of the input when subtracting the
  master bias. [#404]

- Fixed ``combine`` with ``CCDData`` objects using ``StdDevUncertainty`` as
  uncertainty. [#416, #424]

------------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add an additional combination method, ``clip_extrema``, that drops the highest

  not match in ``subtract_bias`` or ``subtract_dark``. [#361, #366]

- Updated the ``Combiner`` class so that it could process images with >2
  dimensions. [#340, #375]

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- ``Combiner`` creates plain array uncertainties when using``average_combine``
  or ``median_combine``. [#351]

- ``flat_correct`` does not properly scale uncertainty in the flat. [#345, #363]

- Error message in weights setter fixed. [#376]


1.0.1 (2016-03-15)
------------------

The 1.0.1 release was a release to fix some minor packaging issues.


1.0.0 (2016-03-15)
------------------

General
^^^^^^^

- ccdproc has now the following requirements:

  - Python 2.7 or 3.4 or later.
  - astropy 1.0 or later
  - numpy 1.9 or later
  - scipy
  - astroscrappy
  - reproject

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add a WCS setter for ``CCDData``. [#256]
- Allow user to set the function used for uncertainty calculation in
  ``average_combine`` and ``median_combine``. [#258]
- Add a new keyword to ImageFileCollection.files_filtered to return the full
  path to a file [#275]
- Added ccd_process for handling multiple steps. [#211]
- CCDData.write now writes multi-extension-FITS files. The mask and uncertainty
  are saved as extensions if these attributes were set. The name of the
  extensions can be altered with the parameters ``hdu_mask`` (default extension
  name ``'MASK'``) and ``hdu_uncertainty`` (default ``'UNCERT'``).
  CCDData.read can read these files and has the same optional parameters. [#302]

Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Issue warning if there are no FITS images in an ``ImageFileCollection``. [#246]
- The overscan_axis argument in subtract_overscan can now be set to
  None, to let subtract_overscan provide a best guess for the axis. [#263]
- Add support for wildcard and reversed FITS style slicing. [#265]
- When reading a FITS file with CCDData.read, if no data exists in the
  primary hdu, the resultant header object is a combination of the
  header information in the primary hdu and the first hdu with data. [#271]
- Changed cosmicray_lacosmic to use astroscrappy for cleaning cosmic rays. [#272]
- CCDData arithmetic with number/Quantity now preserves any existing WCS. [#278]
- Update astropy_helpers to 1.1.1. [#287]
- Drop support for Python 2.6. [#300]
- The ``add_keyword`` parameter now has a default of ``True``, to be more
  explicit. [#310]
- Return name of file instead of full path in ``ImageFileCollection``
  generators. [#315]


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Adding/Subtracting a CCDData instance with a Quantity with a different unit
  produced wrong results. [#291]
- The uncertainty resulting when combining CCDData will be divided by the
  square root of the number of combined pixel [#309]
- Improve documentation for read/write methods on ``CCDData`` [#320]
- Add correct path separator when returning full path from
  ``ImageFileCollection.files_filtered``. [#325]

----------------------

There was no 0.3.2 release because of a packaging error.

- Overscan subtraction failed on non-square images if the overscan axis was the
  first index, ``0``. [#240, #244]

0.3.0 (2015-03-17)
------------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When reading in a FITS file, the extension to be used can be specified.  If
  it is not and there is no data in the primary extension, the first extension
  with data will be used.

- Set wcs attribute when reading from a FITS file that contains WCS keywords
  and write WCS keywords to header when converting to an HDU. [#195]

Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
