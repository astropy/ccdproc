.. note::

    This is not intended to be an introduction to image reduction. While
    performing the steps presented here may be the correct way to reduce data
    in some cases, it is not correct in all cases.

Logging in `ccdproc`
--------------------

All logging in `ccdproc` is done in the sense of recording the steps performed
in image metadata. if you want to do `logging in the python sense of the word
<https://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`_ please see those docs.

There are basically three logging options:

1. Implicit logging: No setup or keywords needed, each of the functions below adds a note to the metadata when it is performed.
2. Explicit logging: You can specify what information is added to the metadata using the ``add_keyword`` argument for any of the functions below.
3. No logging: If you prefer no logging be done you can "opt-out" by calling each function with ``add_keyword=None``.

.. _create_deviation:

Gain correct and create deviation image
----------------------------------------

Uncertainty
+++++++++++

An uncertainty can be calculated from your data with
`~ccdproc.create_deviation`:

    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import ccdproc
    >>> img = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=0.5, size=(100, 232))
    >>> data = ccdproc.CCDData(img, unit=u.adu)
    >>> data_with_deviation = ccdproc.create_deviation(
    ...                           data, gain=1.5 * u.electron/u.adu,
    ...                           readnoise=5 * u.electron)
    >>> data_with_deviation.header['exposure'] = 30.0  # for dark subtraction

The uncertainty, :math:`u_{ij}`, at pixel :math:`(i,~j)` with value
:math:`p_{ij}` is calculated as

.. math::

    u_{ij} = \left(g * p_{ij} + \sigma_{rn}^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}},

where :math:`\sigma_{rn}` is the read noise. Gain is only necessary when the
image units are different than the units of the read noise, and is used only
to calculate the uncertainty. The data itself is not scaled by this function.

As with all of the functions in `ccdproc`, *the input image is not modified*.

In the example above the new image ``data_with_deviation`` has its uncertainty
set.

Gain
++++

To apply a gain to an image, do:

    >>> gain_corrected = ccdproc.gain_correct(data_with_deviation, 1.5*u.electron/u.adu)

The result ``gain_corrected`` has its data *and uncertainty* scaled by the gain
and its unit updated.

There are several ways to provide the gain, among them as an
`astropy.units.Quantity`, as in the example above, as a `ccdproc.Keyword`.
See to documentation for `~ccdproc.gain_correct` for details.

Clean image
-----------

There are two ways to clean an image of cosmic rays. One is to use clipping to
create a mask for a stack of images, as described in :ref:`clipping`.

The other is to replace, in a single image, each pixel that is several
standard deviations from a central value in a region surrounding that pixel.
The methods below describe how to do that.

LACosmic
++++++++

The lacosmic technique identifies cosmic rays by identifying pixels based on a
variation of the Laplacian edge detection.  The algorithm is an implementation
of the code describe in van Dokkum (2001) [1]_ as implemented
in [astroscrappy](https://github.com/astropy/astroscrappy) [2]_.

Use this technique with `~ccdproc.cosmicray_lacosmic`:

    >>> cr_cleaned = ccdproc.cosmicray_lacosmic(gain_corrected, sigclip=5)

median
++++++

Another cosmic ray cleaning algorithm available in ccdproc is `~ccdproc.cosmicray_median`
that is analogous to iraf.imred.crutil.crmedian.   This technique can
be used with `ccdproc.cosmicray_median`:

    >>> cr_cleaned = ccdproc.cosmicray_median(gain_corrected, mbox=11,
    ...                                       rbox=11, gbox=5)

Although `ccdproc` provides functions for identifying outlying pixels and for
calculating the deviation of the background you are free to provide your own
error image instead.

There is one additional argument, ``gbox``, that specifies the size of the box,
centered on a outlying pixel, in which pixel should be grown.  The argument
``rbox`` specifies the size of the box used to calculate a median value if
values for bad pixels should be replaced.

Subtract overscan and trim images
---------------------------------

.. note::

    + Images reduced with `ccdproc` do **NOT** have to come from FITS files. The
      discussion below is intended to ease the transition from the indexing
      conventions used in FITS and IRAF to python indexing.
    + No bounds checking is done when trimming arrays, so indexes that are too
      large are silently set to the upper bound of the array. This is because
      `numpy`, which provides the infrastructure for the arrays in `ccdproc`
      has this behavior.

Indexing: python and FITS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overscan subtraction and image trimming are done with two separate functions.
Both are straightforward to use once you are familiar with python's rules for
array indexing; both have arguments that allow you to specify the part of the
image you want in the FITS standard way. The difference between python and
FITS indexing is that python starts indexes at 0, FITS starts at 1, and the
order of the indexes is switched (FITS follows the FORTRAN convention for
array ordering, python follows the C convention).

The examples below include both python-centric versions and FITS-centric
versions to help illustrate the differences between the two.

Consider an image from a FITS file in which ``NAXIS1=232`` and
``NAXIS2=100``, in which the last 32 columns along ``NAXIS1`` are overscan.

In FITS parlance, the overscan is described by the region ``[201:232,
1:100]``.

If that image has been read into a python array ``img`` by `astropy.io.fits`
then the overscan is ``img[0:100, 200:232]`` (or, more compactly ``img[:,
200:])``, the starting value of the first index  implicitly being zero, and
the ending value for both indices implicitly the last index).

One aspect of python indexing may particularly surprising to newcomers:
indexing goes up to *but not including* the end value. In ``img[0:100,
200:232]`` the end value of the first index is 99 and the second index is
231, both what you would expect given that python indexing starts at zero,
not one.

Those transitioning from IRAF to ccdproc do not need to worry about this too
much because the functions for overscan subtraction and image trimming both
allow you to use the familiar ``BIASSEC`` and ``TRIMSEC`` conventions for
specifying the overscan and region to be retained in a trim.

Overscan subtraction
++++++++++++++++++++

To subtract the overscan in our image from a FITS file in which ``NAXIS1=232`` and
``NAXIS2=100``, in which the last 32 columns along ``NAXIS1`` are overscan, use `~ccdproc.subtract_overscan`:

    >>> # python-style indexing first
    >>> oscan_subtracted = ccdproc.subtract_overscan(cr_cleaned,
    ...                                              overscan=cr_cleaned[:, 200:],
    ...                                              overscan_axis=1)
    >>> # FITS/IRAF-style indexing to accomplish the same thing
    >>> oscan_subtracted = ccdproc.subtract_overscan(cr_cleaned,
    ...                                              fits_section='[201:232,1:100]',
    ...                                              overscan_axis=1)

**Note well** that the argument ``overscan_axis`` *always* follows the python
convention for axis ordering. Since the order of the  indexes in the
``fits_section`` get switched in the (internal) conversion to a python index,
the overscan axis ends up being the *second* axis, which is numbered 1 in
python zero-based numbering.

With the arguments in this example the overscan is averaged over the overscan
columns (i.e. 200 through 231) and then subtracted row-by-row from the
image. The ``median`` argument can be used to median combine instead.

This example is not very realistic: typically one wants to fit a low-order
polynomial to the overscan region and subtract that fit:

    >>> from astropy.modeling import models
    >>> poly_model = models.Polynomial1D(1)  # one-term, i.e. constant
    >>> oscan_subtracted = ccdproc.subtract_overscan(cr_cleaned,
    ...                                              overscan=cr_cleaned[:, 200:],
    ...                                              overscan_axis=1,
    ...                                              model=poly_model)

See the documentation for `astropy.modeling.polynomial` for more examples of the
available models and for a description of creating your own model.

Trim an image
+++++++++++++

The overscan-subtracted image constructed above still contains the overscan
portion. We are assuming came from a FITS file in which ``NAXIS1=232`` and
``NAXIS2=100``, in which the last 32 columns along ``NAXIS1`` are overscan.

Trim it using `~ccdproc.trim_image`,shown below in both python-
style and FITS-style indexing:

    >>> # FITS-style:
    >>> trimmed = ccdproc.trim_image(oscan_subtracted,
    ...                              fits_section='[1:200, 1:100]')
    >>> # python-style:
    >>> trimmed = ccdproc.trim_image(oscan_subtracted[:, :200])

Note again that in python the order of indices is opposite that assumed in
FITS format, that the last value in an index means "up to, but not including",
and that a missing value implies either first or last value.

Those familiar with python may wonder what the point of
`~ccdproc.trim_image` is; it looks like simply indexing
``oscan_subtracted`` would accomplish the same thing. The only additional thing
`~ccdproc.trim_image` does is to make a copy of the image before
trimming it.

.. note::

    By default, python automatically reduces array indices that extend beyond
    the actual length of the array to the  actual length. In practice, this
    means you can supply an invalid shape for, e.g. trimming, and an error
    will not be raised. To make this concrete,
    ``ccdproc.trim_image(oscan_subtracted[:, :200000000])`` will be treated as
    if you had put in the correct upper bound, ``200``.


Subtract bias and dark
----------------------

Both of the functions below propagate the uncertainties in the science and
calibration images if either or both is defined.

Assume in this section that you have created a master bias image called
``master_bias`` and a master dark image called ``master_dark`` that *has been
bias-subtracted* so that it can be scaled by exposure time if necessary.

Subtract the bias with `~ccdproc.subtract_bias`:

    >>> fake_bias_data = np.random.normal(size=trimmed.shape)  # just for illustration
    >>> master_bias = ccdproc.CCDData(fake_bias_data,
    ...                               unit=u.electron,
    ...                               mask=np.zeros(trimmed.shape))
    >>> bias_subtracted = ccdproc.subtract_bias(trimmed, master_bias)

There are several ways you can specify the exposure times of the dark and
science images; see `~ccdproc.subtract_dark` for a full description.

In the example below we assume there is a keyword ``exposure`` in the metadata
of the trimmed image and the master dark and that the units of the exposure
are seconds (note that you can instead explicitly provide these times).

To perform the dark subtraction use `~ccdproc.subtract_dark`:

    >>> master_dark = master_bias.multiply(0.1)  # just for illustration
    >>> master_dark.header['exposure'] = 15.0
    >>> dark_subtracted = ccdproc.subtract_dark(bias_subtracted, master_dark,
    ...                                         exposure_time='exposure',
    ...                                         exposure_unit=u.second,
    ...                                         scale=True)

Note that scaling of the dark is not done by default; use ``scale=True`` to
scale.

Correct flat
------------

Given a flat frame called ``master_flat``, use `~ccdproc.flat_correct` to
perform this calibration:

    >>> fake_flat_data = np.random.normal(loc=1.0, scale=0.05, size=trimmed.shape)
    >>> master_flat = ccdproc.CCDData(fake_flat_data, unit=u.electron)
    >>> reduced_image = ccdproc.flat_correct(dark_subtracted, master_flat)

As with the additive calibrations, uncertainty is propagated in the division.

The flat is scaled by the mean of ``master_flat`` before dividing.

If desired, you can specify a minimum value the flat can have (e.g. to prevent
division by zero). Any pixels in the flat whose value is less than ``min_value``
are replaced with ``min_value``):

    >>> reduced_image = ccdproc.flat_correct(dark_subtracted, master_flat,
    ...                                      min_value=0.9)

Basic Processing
----------------

All of the basic processing steps can be accomplished in a single step using
`~ccdproc.ccd_process`. This step will call overscan correct, trim, gain
correct, add a bad pixel mask, create an uncertainty frame, subtract the
master bias, and flat-field the image. The unit of the master calibration
frames must match that of the image *after* the gain, if any, is applied. In
the example below, ``img`` has unit ``adu``, but the master frames have unit
``electron``. These can be run together as:

     >>> ccd = ccdproc.CCDData(img, unit=u.adu)
     >>> ccd.header['exposure'] = 30.0  # for dark subtraction
     >>> nccd = ccdproc.ccd_process(ccd, oscan='[201:232,1:100]',
     ...                            trim='[1:200, 1:100]',
     ...                            error=True,
     ...                            gain=2.0*u.electron/u.adu,
     ...                            readnoise=5*u.electron,
     ...                            dark_frame=master_dark,
     ...                            exposure_key='exposure',
     ...                            exposure_unit=u.second,
     ...                            dark_scale=True,
     ...                            master_flat=master_flat)


Reprojecting onto a different image footprint
---------------------------------------------

An image with coordinate information (WCS) can be reprojected onto a different
image footprint. The underlying functionality is proved by the `reproject
project`_. Please see :ref:`reprojection` for more details.


Data Quality Flags (Bitfields and bitmasks)
-------------------------------------------

Some FITS files contain data quality flags or bitfield extension, while these
are currently not supported as part of `~astropy.nddata.CCDData` these can be loaded
manually using `~astropy.io.fits` and converted to regular (`numpy`-like) masks
(with `~ccdproc.bitfield_to_boolean_mask`) that are supported by many
operations in `ccdproc`.

.. code::

    import numpy as np
    from astropy.io import fits
    from ccdproc import bitfield_to_boolean_mask, CCDData

    fitsfilename = 'some_fits_file.fits'
    bitfieldextension = extensionname_or_extensionnumber

    # Read the data of the fits file as CCDData object
    ccd = CCDData.read(fitsfilename)

    # Open the file again (assuming the bitfield is saved in the same FITS file)
    mask = bitfield_to_boolean_mask(fits.getdata(fitsfilename, bitfieldextension))

    # Save the mask as "mask" attribute of the ccd
    ccd.mask = mask


Filter and Convolution
----------------------

There are several convolution and filter functions for `numpy.ndarray` across
the scientific python packages:

- ``scipy.ndimage.filters``, offers a variety of filters.
- ``astropy.convolution``, offers some filters which also handle ``NaN`` values.
- ``scikit-image.filters``, offers several filters which can also handle masks
  but are mostly limited to special data types (mostly unsigned integers).

For convenience one of these is also accessible through the ``ccdproc``
package namespace which accepts `~astropy.nddata.CCDData` objects and then also
returns one:

- `~ccdproc.median_filter`

Median Filter
+++++++++++++

The median filter is especially useful if the data contains sharp noise peaks
which should be removed rather than propagated:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import ccdproc
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from astropy.modeling.functional_models import Gaussian2D
    from astropy.utils.misc import NumpyRNGContext
    from scipy.ndimage import uniform_filter

    # Create some source signal
    source = Gaussian2D(60, 70, 70, 20, 25)
    data = source(*np.mgrid[0:250, 0:250])

    # and another one
    source = Gaussian2D(70, 150, 180, 15, 15)
    data += source(*np.mgrid[0:250, 0:250])

    # create some random signals
    with NumpyRNGContext(1234):
        noise = np.random.exponential(40, (250, 250))
        # remove low signal
        noise[noise < 100] = 0
        data += noise

    # create a CCD object based on the data
    ccd = ccdproc.CCDData(data, unit='adu')

    # Create some plots
    fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3)
    ax1.set_title('Unprocessed')
    ax1.imshow(ccd, origin='lower', interpolation='none', cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax2.set_title('Mean filtered')
    ax2.imshow(uniform_filter(ccd.data, 5), origin='lower', interpolation='none', cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax3.set_title('Median filtered')
    ax3.imshow(ccdproc.median_filter(ccd, 5), origin='lower', interpolation='none', cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
